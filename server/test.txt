There once was an ugly duckling,
With feathers all stubby and brown,
And all the other ducks in so many words,
Said get out of town!



There once was an ugly duckling,
With feathers all stubby and brown,
And all the other ducks in so many words,
Said get out of town!

All through the winter time,
He hid himself away.
